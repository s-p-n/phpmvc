PHPMVC
======
The purpose of PHPMVC is for you to build an MVC framework in PHP. It does
not have any trash or wasted code, and despite the filesize and file line count,
there is very little code in this. The reason is due to lots of comments 
including but not limited to BSD license and intensive documentation).

PHPMVC is a very bare-bones framework. Please read the code commments
for more information. I spent most of my time working on my code 
documentation skills, so it really should be trivial once you start 
tearing it open to see what's inside.

Each file in PHPMVC is released open source under the BSD license. 
The entire source may be modified and you may change/copy/paste/rename 
code as you wish.

Enjoy the low-restriction provided by the BSD license.
